      <h2 className="title"> About Me</h2>

      <p> I am a software engineer with a customer service background, seeing that coding has great opportunities allowing me to start from the ground up, I've been enjoying the journey coding has put me on. My drive to learn new skills from my peers and give them new insight to take from me has helped me to grow into a stronger coder. My interest in the gaming world, lead me to see how amazing the coding world can be and continue growing with every new challenge.</p>
